                    The community I want to talk about and which I belong to is the 'Spanish Game Jams Community'. This community started in the 
                    second edition of a national game jam in Spain. It started as the general Discord server for the game jam, where news was 
                    published, teams could sign in, etc. This server started to scale up so quickly since this second edition got so popular among 
                    the indie and amateur Spanish dev community. A lot of new people, including me, were joining this one-week jam and as a result, 
                    the jam ended up with lots of games developed.
                    </br></br>
                    The thing did not stop there, the vast majority of the community gave very useful feedback to the games developed for the jam 
                    plus they started to create events around the games. Such as streamings playing the games, interviews with the developers, 
                    creating hashtags to share their creations... . All this made a community that went further than just the jam.
                    </br></br>
                    In this community, you can do a lot of thing as a game developer. From gathering a team for the next game jam, to share your 
                    creations and gain visibility or discuss the most recently released game. Above everything, it is a community that tries to 
                    help developers with their ideas and development processes.
                    </br></br>
                    It is a community that is mostly 24/7 active, where you can ask any doubt and it is going to be answered, even if it is a 
                    beginner or a more professional question. Everyone tries to help in their own field so it is an active community where you 
                    can get help for almost every field of the game development process.
                    </br></br>
                    All the events are digital so everyone can attend them, and the main focus of those events is to make publicity of the 
                    developments made by the community, with hashtags or streams. These events make it easier to make a name for yourself in the 
                    indie dev community. With all the advantages that this can carry, like make it easier to obtain a job in an indie studio or 
                    gain more respect among the developer community.
                    </br></br>
                    Other events where this community has a great impact and grows exponentially is in the different game jams because there are 
                    channels dedicated to giving publicity to these events and gathering a team to participate in them. This is a great way to 
                    make new contacts and do some networking and maybe even recruit new members for a studio or a collaboration project.
                    </br></br>
                    Although I would like to see if in the future they could organise meetings with renowned Spanish developers or create 
                    development workshops to give some tips to new developers on how to start a professional project. But, because this community 
                    has no income at all, these type of events are hard to get ahead.
                    </br></br>
                    One thing that I really like about this community, is that because its creation was so spontaneous it has a healthy community 
                    where everyone involved in it shares the same passion to develop videogames. This lows the level of toxicity that you may 
                    encounter in other communities of this size. Here no one feels superior to another person because we all know that we came 
                    here to learn and grow as a developer, even so, we have a group of moderators to ensure that everyone respect every person in 
                    the community.
                    </br></br>
                    If I had to tell the benefits of this community to someone new to the game developing world I would say that this is a community 
                    where you can find most of the solutions to the problems you may find when developing a videogame. People share their tips and 
                    assets that made their lives easier in their development. You can socialise and do networking to expand your connections in the 
                    industry.
                    </br></br>
                    There are also discussion channels where you can share an idea and get feedback on how to improve it or what may work or not, 
                    so you can have an overview before you start working on it. If you are lucky enough you can even get feedback or tips from a 
                    well-known developer that has already been successful in this industry, we have some of those in our community.
                    </br></br>
                    For me, this community has helped me a lot with some issues I had in one of my projects and I could not find the solution on 
                    the internet. Also, I have discovered some useful assets that will be beneficial for future projects that I have in mind.
