                <h1>The 'Call and Response' game</h1>
                <p>
                    The idea of this assessment was to create a text-based videogame in two weeks using the theme 'Call and Response' 
                    as the idea for the game.
                </p>
                </br></br>
                <h3>The idea (mood board)</h3>
                <img src="../images/Moodboard.png">
                </br></br>
                <p>
                    First of all, was to take an idea and develop it. For this, we used a technique called mood-board, where we would 
                    be posting screenshots of items or different references that will shape our ideas.
                    </br></br>
                    We knew that because of the time we had, only two weeks, it should be a simple game with one or two mechanics at most. 
                    We decided that a pixel art aesthetic will fit perfectly this game also it would be easier for the artist to draw 
                    different assets in a short time.
                    </br></br>
                    That is why we used the game <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a> as a reference because they have lots of different assets with a simple 
                    pixel art aesthetic but, they are very distinguishable between them. With this aesthetic, we knew it had to be a 2D game 
                    with a top-view perspective.
                    </br></br>
                    We knew how the game was going to look but, we did not have an idea about the mechanics. That was the tougher part of the 
                    idea process, we didn't want to make the typical text game where you have to read a lot of text and then select between 
                    some options and read more text again. That is why we decided to make it text-based through dialogues where people will 
                    tell you something in short sentences so it won't be hard for the player to read it. With all this in mind, we thought 
                    what could be the best kind of game to fit in this dialogue-based mechanic. We went through some ideas like a text chat on 
                    a mobile phone or a detective game with clues in a crime scene and some suspects, but we didn't know how to develop these 
                    ideas to make a whole videogame.
                    </br></br>
                    Even so, this process was not a waste of time we decided that we could aim for a puzzle-like game where different will ask 
                    you for something in a more or less cryptic way, where you have to deduce what item they are asking for. We finally had a 
                    core mechanic for the game but, we still needed how to make that individual mechanic into a complete videogame.
                    </br></br>
                    This is where the story takes part in the action we had to give it a meaning to the mechanic to make sense for the player. 
                    Taking into account that we were going to talk to different people who would be asking for different objects we thought about 
                    a trading chain, where you start with an object which you can trade for something else and that new object trade it for 
                    another thing until you get the final and desired object. What desired object the character would want? We made that 
                    question to ourselves and somehow we came up with the idea of a key, a key that will liberate the character from... 
                    the city! A dull and desolate city where the character doesn't feel to belong to.
                    </br></br>
                    In this way is how we developed the process of creating an idea from the very beginning with just a theme and a game type. 
                    We managed to develop each part individually and then put all of them together to create a simple videogame from scratch.
                    </br></br>
                    I found this experience quite fascinating since I like to create little prototypes of ideas just for fun and to improve in 
                    specific things without the pressure of having a big project in your hands and a lot of people involved.
                    </br></br>
                    Although something that I would have liked to have in this project since it is a text-based game is a better and deeper 
                    narrative with different options to choose and more significant NPCs in the world. Now the options are very limited and 
                    straightforward, you don't have different paths to solve the puzzle and our main mechanic that is trading objects it is not 
                    very explored, the item you have is the object you are going to trade next.
                    </br></br>
                    On the other hand, I am quite happy with my part, the trading system I developed. I think it is a very scalable and robust 
                    system where you can have as many objects as you want and as many characters as you want with the items they need and the object 
                    they will give you, all that without needing to write a single line of code.
                    </br></br>
                    For me, that is something to feel proud of because I think it is a useful tool for any designer who wants to implement this 
                    mechanic in his game. In my opinion, a game programmer not only has to develop the game itself but also has to make life easier 
                    for their designers and artists.
