                <h1>The two systems</h1>
                <p style="font-size: small;">08/11/2020</p>
                <p>
                    For this work, we had to search two different systems, one cultural and another technical that match our interests 
                    so we could give a little overview of our interests to our classmates to make working groups for the next sprint.                    
                </p>
                </br></br>
                <h3>Cultural system</h3>
                <img src="../images/Greek gods.jpg">
                </br></br>
                <p>
                    For the cultural system, I chose Greek Mythology. Since I was a child I have loved Greek mythology: its gods, monsters, 
                    heroes, myths... but what really captivated me was when I discovered that all those myths and fantasy were just their way 
                    to explain the world and the human behaviour in a simple way, through myths, so everybody was able to understand it.
                    </br></br>
                    When I was younger I looked into the most popular myths and gods, their stories how they became the god of each element 
                    and that sort of things. This year the videogame <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/" target="_blank">Hades</a> was released and that passion that was 
                    hidden somewhere else raised again.
                    </br></br>
                    I started thinking and investigating again about all those myths and I concluded that most of them are valid even nowadays 
                    to show how we keep similar behaviours even though we have progressed as a society (surely, changing the parts where they 
                    kidnapped every person they wanted just because they could and the rapes).
                    </br></br>
                    Another important point is that we do not have to forget that in the end, this was a religion, so it also had dogmas about 
                    was good and bad and how people should behave, this is not very different to the current religions where they also try to 
                    teach people to distinguish between good and evil and the punishments they will get if they do not follow theses dogmas, 
                    a place in hell or for Greek mythology a different and worse level in the underworld.
                    </br></br>
                    I think we can say that Greek mythology is one of the bases for the next and current religions that we have these days, 
                    it tried to explain the world with the different gods that could intervene in people's lives and use different natural 
                    elements at their convenience, but also tried to make people behave in a way they thought was the correct one, not very 
                    distinct from the current religions, with the difference that they do not explain how things happen in nature because 
                    science has evolved enough to explain it.
                    </br></br></br>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Technical system</h3>
                <img src="../images/traffic management.jpg">
                </br></br>
                <p>
                    For my technical system, I chose a traffic managing system driven by an AI. I selected this system because even though 
                    nowadays it may seem complicated to implement it in a city, I really think that in a not very far away future we can see 
                    these type of systems working in big cities.
                    </br></br>
                    What amazes me of this type of technology is how it has to give a good response on a very short time with lots of complex 
                    variables such as all the cars, traffic lights and pedestrians that may be at a crossroad. Another complexity added to this 
                    is the behaviour that some drivers or pedestrians may have, like crossing when the red light is on or speeding up when the 
                    yellow light is blinking and things like that.
                    </br></br>
                    I would like to see a future where technology has advanced to a point where it can handle most of the basic human routine 
                    with the result of making people's lives easier and safer, as the example here with the traffic management or the self-driven 
                    cars. Although I am aware of the possibilities these systems can offer to make bad things with them.
                    </br></br>
                    People may try to attack them as a new way of cyber-terrorism to create chaos in a city or governments can use them to track 
                    people down or find out their routines but I think that overall with all the pros and cons they will benefit the population.
                    </br></br>
                    These type of AI-driven systems aren't here to only stay but to get more and more involved in people's daily lives and the 
                    fear that people may have about them can be dispelled with transparency on how they are going to work and the direct benefits 
                    they will have over the population.
                    </br></br></br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    As an overall conclusion of the activity, I have to say I really liked sharing my thoughts with the group I was in and 
                    also hearing their comments on my ideas. Listening to their ideas was quite interesting too, there was a girl, Emma, that 
                    presented us a Japanese game about a visual novel where you had to debate with your classmates as it was like a debate club 
                    and the way she presented it and how she described the dialogue system of the game was quite interesting for a person who is 
                    not much into visual novels, like me.
                    </br></br>
                    Plus, thanks to the Greek mythology system I was able to find another person who was also looking for a team and one of his 
                    systems was about Greek mythology as well so we started to think about a game idea based on Greek mythology.
