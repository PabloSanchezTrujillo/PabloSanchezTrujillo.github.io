                <h1>Sprint 2: interactive digital artefact</h1>
                <p>
                    The procces of creating a digital artefact within two weeks. This artefact should have two different systems,
                    a system of production and a thematic one.
                </p>
                </br></br>
                <h3>Artefact idea: our two systems</h3>
                <img src="../images/Systemic games.png">
                </br></br>
                <p>
                    To figure out what systems we were going to use in our artefact we had to know first, what is a system in a game? To answer 
                    this question, we started to search for different systems in games and how they implemented them.
                    </br></br>
                    Searching for how we could define a system in a game and how to implement them we discovered a series of really helpful videos 
                    (link de referencia) that let us understand what different types of systems we could use for our game.
                    </br></br>
                    The thematic system was quite easy to figure out, we knew we wanted to use the Greek gods as our main element for the 
                    aesthetics and the narrative since the player will be able to use powers given by certain gods.
                    </br></br>
                    On the other hand, figuring out the system we wanted to use for our mechanics was harder. We had the powers/elements idea on 
                    mind but we did not know how to fit that idea in our gameplay until we came up with the thought that those powers did not have 
                    to be some type of attack or ability but instead they could interact with the world's physics.
                    </br></br>
                    Digging into this idea we thought that our production system could be related to how the player interacts with the world by 
                    using his powers to change the physical state of the objects around him.
                    </br></br>
                    Now, that we have a mechanic for our gameplay and the aesthetics sorted out we only have to find a way to make them work 
                    together. Because of the little time we had for this project, we decided to go for a 2D art style. For the gameplay, we 
                    concluded that the best way to make the player interact with the physics was by puzzles where the player had to use the 
                    different powers he has to solve them. This is how we ended up with a 2D physics-based puzzle game.
                    </br></br>
                    For designing our puzzles we want something that it is not obvious at first sight yet it does not require the player to think 
                    for five minutes to figure the puzzle out. We want a design that allows the player to explore and experiment with the different 
                    powers given so it does not get stuck in a puzzle, the player will always be able to experiment with the different powers until 
                    he gets the right way of solving the puzzle.
                    </br></br>
                    Once we had our game more or less figured it out we had to think about the target audience this game could have, we thought 
                    that our audience may be players that like to be challenged with puzzles that require some kind of creativity to solve them 
                    and also people who are interested in Greek mythology and want games that use it as its main thematic.
                    </br></br>
                    As a conclusion, I am quite happy to say that this activity helped me out to identify what a system in a game is and to have 
                    that in mind when I start a new project.
                    </br></br>
                    As with the previous sprint, I really enjoyed the experience of coming out with a more or less complete idea for a game from 
                    scratch. It is always a very pleasant experience to devise things from the beginning and in the end, have an overview of what 
                    you want to create.
                    </br></br></br>
