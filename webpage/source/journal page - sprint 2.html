                <h1>Sprint 2: interactive digital artefact</h1>
                <p>
                    The procces of creating a digital artefact within two weeks. This artefact should have two different systems,
                    a system of production and a thematic one.
                </p>
                </br></br>
                <h3>Artefact idea: our two systems</h3>
                <img src="../images/Systemic games.png">
                </br></br>
                <p>
                    To figure out what systems we were going to use in our artefact we had to know first, what is a system in a game? To answer 
                    this question, we started to search for different systems in games and how they implemented them.
                    </br></br>
                    Searching for how we could define a system in a game and how to implement them we discovered a series of
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZc7yGdahkY&list=PL5KbKbJ6Gf98b44ckrGGVhuxtPN4u20K7" target="_blank">really helpful videos</a>  
                    that let us understand what different types of systems we could use for our game.
                    </br></br>
                    The thematic system was quite easy to figure out, we knew we wanted to use the Greek gods as our main element for the 
                    aesthetics and the narrative since the player will be able to use powers given by certain gods.
                    </br></br>
                    On the other hand, figuring out the system we wanted to use for our mechanics was harder. We had the powers/elements idea on 
                    mind but we did not know how to fit that idea in our gameplay until we came up with the thought that those powers did not have 
                    to be some type of attack or ability but instead they could interact with the world's physics.
                    </br></br>
                    Digging into this idea we thought that our production system could be related to how the player interacts with the world by 
                    using his powers to change the physical state of the objects around him.
                    </br></br>
                    Now, that we have a mechanic for our gameplay and the aesthetics sorted out we only have to find a way to make them work 
                    together. Because of the little time we had for this project, we decided to go for a 2D art style. For the gameplay, we 
                    concluded that the best way to make the player interact with the physics was by puzzles where the player had to use the 
                    different powers he has to solve them. This is how we ended up with a 2D physics-based puzzle game.
                    </br></br>
                    For designing our puzzles we want something that it is not obvious at first sight yet it does not require the player to think 
                    for five minutes to figure the puzzle out. We want a design that allows the player to explore and experiment with the different 
                    powers given so it does not get stuck in a puzzle, the player will always be able to experiment with the different powers until 
                    he gets the right way of solving the puzzle.
                    </br></br>
                    Once we had our game more or less figured it out we had to think about the target audience this game could have, we thought 
                    that our audience may be players that like to be challenged with puzzles that require some kind of creativity to solve them 
                    and also people who are interested in Greek mythology and want games that use it as its main thematic.
                    </br></br>
                    As a conclusion, I am quite happy to say that this activity helped me out to identify what a system in a game is and to have 
                    that in mind when I start a new project.
                    </br></br>
                    As with the previous sprint, I really enjoyed the experience of coming out with a more or less complete idea for a game from 
                    scratch. It is always a very pleasant experience to devise things from the beginning and in the end, have an overview of what 
                    you want to create.
                    </br></br></br>
                </p> 

                <h3>Improving our game. The first feedback</h3>
                <p>
                    After the first week of working on our artefact, we had the first feedback session with our classmates. It was a great 
                    opportunity to show the first glance of our mechanics and get quick feedback to check if we were going in the right direction 
                    or we should change something before continuing with that mechanic.
                    </br></br>
                    The good thing about having such early feedback in the prototyping process is that you can change or even leave a mechanic 
                    without having lost much time in the development.
                    </br></br>
                    For us, it was a useful session since we did not know how to approach the key controls for our different powers, and that was 
                    a very important decision because the player is constantly changing between powers in our game. We decided that the fastest 
                    way to change powers was using the mouse wheel up and down in a circular array. The surprise came when we saw in our 
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bDl2-9HTgRe6fblTJ_HVdWL70l8A-8YavD0RHF48Odk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">feedback 
                    form</a> that most people prefer to use a determined set of key to change directly between powers instead of scrolling with 
                    the mouse wheel.
                    </br></br>
                    In order to solve this, we bind one of the numbers from 1-4 to one of the powers so the player could change immediately to 
                    the power they wanted but instead of replacing the mouse wheel with this option, we let people use any of those indistinctly. 
                    We also added a key for changing between powers as if you were using the mouse wheel, but for those people who do not have a 
                    mouse or do not feel comfortable using it.
                    </br></br>
                    We also received the information that most people did not know how to use the powers or how they affect the environment so 
                    they just tried randomly the different powers until something happened.
                    </br></br>
                    We gave it a thought on how to improve this and make the powers more intuitive for the player but we did not come with an 
                    idea besides creating a tutorial, which we did not have enough time to develop it properly, or just writing down on the manual 
                    how the powers work which is what we finally did.
                    </br></br>
                    In conclusion, this session gave us really good feedback on some changes we had to do before progressing with the development 
                    and how to approach some features in the future. We also got the conclusion that the powers mechanic was interesting and 
                    enjoyable enough to make it our main mechanic for our gameplay.
                    </br></br></br>
