                <p>
                    For this assignment, we had to create an animated avatar with stuff we had at home that was meaningful for us, 
                    so the avatar would have some personal meaning for us. One thing I knew for this task was that I wanted to create 
                    a more or less humanoid avatar, so it had to have a face, feet and if possible hands.
                    </br></br>
                    There was one problem for me because this is not my home country I only had the essentials with me so I had to 
                    figure out what objects with a minimum meaning I could use for the avatar.
                    </br></br>
                    I wanted to reflect on my interests and some details of my personality, so  I decided to use my favourite pair of shoes 
                    because I really like shoes especially the ones with a sporty style. Then I used my board, not only because it is 
                    something I use almost every day and helps me with my ideas but because it was perfect for making the body and the 
                    face of my avatar since I could draw any face on it. Also, I wanted to reflect my passion, videogames, so that's 
                    why I decided to use my Nintendo Switch as part of the avatar, I wanted it to seem like it was being grabbed by the 
                    avatar as if it had hands but... the result didn't quite achieve that feeling. 
                    </br></br>
                    When I saw the avatar with all these objects I kept feeling that I could use something to give a bit more information 
                    about me, so looking around the room I saw a chocolate bar (half-eaten) on the table so I decided to put it also 
                    in the avatar. I struggled to try to figure out how to connect it with the rest of the 'body' because it was quite 
                    difficult to somehow attach it to the avatar, so I decided to just put it on one of the shoes.
                    </br></br>
                    For the animation, I thought since it had feet it could be cool to make it walk. I put the camera on the 
                    floor to have a better perspective of the movement and finally, I just made one step per frame. The problem was 
                    that every time I tried to move it something will fall off so I had to be very quickly and put some holders 
                    on the back of the board.
                    </br></br>
                    In my personal opinion, I think that the final result was quite satisfying. 
                    I have never considered my person a very creative one since I prefer the technical part of the games 
                    but I was happy with the final result I think it reflects more or less my main interests funnily and attractively. 
                    Also making the animation frame by frame was a fun experience because you have to check that every frame connects well 
                    with the one before and it doesn't jump any position.
