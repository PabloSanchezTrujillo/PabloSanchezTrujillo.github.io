                    On this project, we did the process of bringing into a new media something that was already done in another media 
                    or that existed in the real world.
                    </br></br>
                    I wasn't sure about what thing we could bring into a new format and yet maintain its essence but my 
                    working mate had a very specific and clear idea of what he wanted to do so he propose me his idea. 
                    The idea was to turn popular film scenes into a sort of graphic novel where the player would play as a character 
                    of that scene and he would have more options to say or do than just the original ones from the movie. 
                    The particular example he explained to me was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4PkBCD4mdY" target="_blank">the 
                    scene from 'Pulp fiction'</a> where Julius went to meet a boy 
                    who owed his boss some money. At the end of this scene, there is a moment when Julius ask the boy several questions and 
                    he answers 'what?', a response that Julius dislikes so much. When in the final question the boy answered one 
                    more time 'what?' Julius got so angry he started shooting at him to his death.
                    </br></br>
                    The idea for our remediation was to play as the boy, named Brett, but we could answer 'what?' to any question 
                    or in any moment we wanted to. Until he would get so angry that he would start shooting at you, ending before the scene.
                    </br></br>
                    I liked his idea, I thought it was a really good way of remediating something into a more modern media where the viewer 
                    could take action in what was happening on the screen. Also, I wanted for some time to create a dialogue tree system and 
                    this was a very good opportunity to do so. The time for developing the project was very short so it was going to be a 
                    simple prototype and see if it was useful and scalable for further bigger projects.
                    </br></br>
                    Making the project was fun and interesting, it allowed me to experiment with some ideas I had for developing the 
                    dialogue system. I finally designed it and even though it is not the best approach because it gets messy when it starts 
                    to have a lot of dialogues and different possibilities it does work for simple dialogues and quick prototyping. 
                    The most important thing is that now I have a base to work on which I can try to improve and develop a better and more 
                    scalable dialogue system that I can actually use in bigger projects which may have more complex dialogue branches.
                    </br></br>
                    I am quite happy with the final product, although it has some bugs and the visual aspect is very simple we managed to 
                    finish it on time with more or less good playability. For me, it was a good project because I had the chance to develop 
                    something that I wanted but never had the opportunity to do it before and in the process, I learnt what to do and what 
                    to avoid when creating a system like that one.
