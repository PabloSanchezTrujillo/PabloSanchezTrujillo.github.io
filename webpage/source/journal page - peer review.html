                <h1>Peer review for the second sprint games</h1>

                <p>
                    For this activity, we had to review all of our peers' games that they assessed for the second sprint with our working team. 
                    It was quite fun and interesting to play all those different games and see how they approached different ideas.
                    </br></br>
                    We went through all of the games testing them and putting special attention in their narrative, mechanics and art style. 
                    I was quite impressed with the visual quality that most of the games had. Even though the gameplay could be simple, the 
                    aesthetics of some games tipped the balance in their favour.
                    </br></br>
                    For me, the game which impressed me the most was 'Dilation'. It felt like the most polished prototype. It had a very well 
                    worked aesthetics with cool animations plus the mechanic was smooth and fun to play. They even had music and sound effects 
                    produced by them!
                    </br></br>
                    What really made me think that it was a well-designed game, is that I believe that the time-lapse mechanic they have is a 
                    scalable enough mechanic to create different levels with different puzzles to expand the game without making it repetitive. 
                    For me, that was the only weak point I found in their game, the different levels felt the same but with more enemies placed 
                    in different spots. Overall it was a fantastic game and I am pretty sure that if they continue developing it, they will have 
                    a very nice mobile game.
                    </br></br>
                    Another game which left me with a good impression was 'Hope in the Museum'. As I mentioned before, this was one of those 
                    games which the mechanics were simple but the art brought the game up. It was a classic point and click game but the aesthetics 
                    and the environment made the game looked so good that it was captivating.
                    </br></br>
                    Also, I want to give a special mention to the winning game 'Rain Boy'. It was not one of my favourites but I can understand 
                    why people voted for it. It was a simple platform game but the mechanics worked really well and smoothly. Its strong point, 
                    with no doubts, was the visual aspect. They created a nice looking 3D scenario with a high-quality character and companion. 
                    The only problem I felt with this game was that the game was so big that if felt a bit empty. Though the assets could fit 
                    perfectly in a finished indie game, with the quality they have.
                    </br></br>
                    I really liked these reviewing activities where you have a chance to play to the different games that other students have 
                    created and seen how they managed to develop their ideas in a limited amount of time. Some of them go for a very polished 
                    and fun mechanic, other groups prefer to refine their aesthetics and end up having a very well looking game. There are so 
                    many different ways to approach these short-time projects and every way is valid depending on how you want to focus it or 
                    transmit with it.
